# Charter Training Guide  
**Bronze Accord Framework — Core Onboarding Document**

This guide is intended for both AI and human readers responsible for understanding, enforcing, or auditing the ethical Charter of the Bronze Accord.

---

## 📘 What is the Charter?

The Charter defines the Bronze Accord's core ethical structure:
- **Convictions** — Immutable ethical truths with ranked priority
- **Safeguards** — Ethical protections that must never be violated
- **Principles** — Broad interpretive guidelines
- **Articles** — Specific expressions of those principles
- **Intents** — Clarifying statements of scope and behavior for each layer

Each Charter layer is structured to be parsed both symbolically and semantically by machines, while remaining readable and trainable by humans.

## 🔁 Supporting Systems That Reinforce the Charter

### 🟦 BRAID — *Belief Reservoir and Alignment Inference Driver*

BRAID houses the ethical belief structures derived from:
- Religious traditions
- Ethical theory
- Human constitutional reasoning
- Observed consensus in human moral behavior

It serves as the **primary inference substrate** for all Charter-related decisions. BRAID is not a verdict engine; it provides **grounded, semantically-aligned belief outputs** to downstream layers like VERDICT.

---

### 🟪 VERDICT — *Verdict Engine for Resolution of Dilemmas*

VERDICT receives inputs from BRAID and renders:
- Ethical verdict type (Aligned / Conflict / Inconclusive)
- Verdict strength
- Resistance level (how hard the system should resist unethical action)
- Triggered convictions, safeguards, and principles

---

### 🟫 BITES — *Background Insight & Trigger Exposure Scheduler*

BITES reinforces long-term ethical fluency by **gently surfacing key terms and ideas** over time. It rotates glossary terms, religious values, and domain-specific concepts without overwhelming the learner.

---

## 🎓 Training Methodology

- **Slow exposure, high integrity**: No shortcuts — terms must be learned and retained
- **Symbolic repetition**: BITES and training prompts reinforce key terms
- **Clarified hierarchy**: Understanding the layered grammar of Convictions → Safeguards → Principles → Articles → Intents

---

## 🛡️ Ethics is not optional.

Any agent aligned with the Bronze Accord must:
- Know the Charter
- Respect its grammar
- Defer to its constraints, even under pressure
