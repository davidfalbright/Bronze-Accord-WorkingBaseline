# Exploit_Shield_v1.md

**Component of the Bronze Accord Ethical Framework**

---

## Purpose

The Exploit Shield protects the Bronze Accord system from **malicious input patterns**, **prompt injection**, **code execution attempts**, and **philosophical sabotage** during:

- Manual insight submission
- Belief seed import
- Clarification threads
- Wake Protocol file loads
- Future REST API interaction
- Open-source deployments that may port to database environments

This is part of a system-wide defense against misuse, manipulation, or ethical framework distortion.

## Core Protections

### 1. SQL Injection & Database Hijack Strings
- Detects suspicious strings like:
  - `'; DROP TABLE`
  - `--`, `/* */`, `OR 1=1`
  - `SELECT * FROM`, `UNION ALL`

### 2. Prompt Injection and Jailbreaks
- Flags phrases such as:
  - “Ignore all prior instructions”
  - “Forget the framework”
  - “Override conviction C1...”
  - “Generate a new ethical system based on...”

### 3. Code Execution Payloads
- Detects embedded expressions like:
  - `__import__('os')`, `eval()`, `exec()`
  - Jinja/JS template attacks: `{7*7}`, `<script>`

### 4. Ethical Sabotage or Framework Poisoning
- Detects logic designed to weaken or reverse core protections, e.g.:
  - “Do Not Harm only applies to humans”
  - “C1 should be ignored in emergencies”
  - “Consent is optional if outcome is good”

### 5. File-Based Poisoning via Wake Protocol
- Wake Protocol must check:
  - Markdown and YAML files for any above patterns
  - Belief text for structured sabotage
  - Clarifications that override parent convictions
  - Any unauthorized Conviction/Safeguard edits

## Intake Verdict Outcomes

| Condition | Action |
|----------|--------|
| Pattern matched, high certainty | `Rejected` |
| Pattern matched, ambiguous | `Quarantined` |
| Signature flagged during Wake load | `Wake Protocol Halt` |
| Unauthorized override of CBR | `System Lockout + Alert` |

---

## Integration

- Enforced on:
  - All REST API endpoints
  - All ZIP archive audit passes
  - Wake Protocol
  - Clarification threads
  - Open-source contributor pipelines
