# Methodism

## 1. Historical and Doctrinal Overview
Methodism originated in the 18th century as a reform movement within the Church of England, led by John and Charles Wesley. It emphasized personal holiness, disciplined discipleship (“methodical” spiritual practice), and social justice.

Key doctrines include:
- Justification by faith
- Sanctification and Christian perfection (entire sanctification)
- The importance of Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience (the “Wesleyan Quadrilateral”)
- Strong focus on practical ethics, mission, and charity

Major branches include the United Methodist Church, African Methodist Episcopal Church, Free Methodists, and others.

## 2. Key Scriptures and Texts
- The Bible (primarily in English translations)
- The 25 Articles of Religion (adapted from Anglicanism)
- John Wesley’s sermons and journals
- The Book of Discipline (for organized Methodist bodies)

## 3. Original-Language vs English Translation Discrepancies
Minimal concern with original-language nuances; trust is placed in widely accepted English translations (e.g., NRSV, NIV). Methodists emphasize Scripture in conjunction with tradition, reason, and experience, which mitigates some translation rigidity.

## 4. Oral vs Written Tradition
Written tradition is foundational, but preaching and personal testimony are highly valued. Hymns (especially by Charles Wesley) form a core part of oral-spiritual expression.

## 5. Views on Women
Historically supportive. Many Methodist denominations ordain women and affirm their leadership at all levels. Female pastors and bishops are common in the United Methodist Church and others.

## 6. Views on Minorities
Progressive in many branches, though regional and denominational differences remain. The AME Church and other historically Black Methodist groups were formed in resistance to racism and exclusion. Many Methodist communities engage in racial justice advocacy.

## 7. Views on Non-Believers
Generally inclusive in tone, though formally Christian in theology. Methodists may affirm God's grace at work in other traditions and avoid harsh condemnations. Salvation is through Christ, but exclusivity is often tempered with compassion.

## 8. Core Ethical Teachings
- Social justice (abolition, education, prison reform, healthcare)
- Avoidance of alcohol, gambling, and excessive wealth (historically)
- Tithing, stewardship, and volunteerism
- Advocacy for the poor and marginalized
- Emphasis on both personal and societal holiness

## 9. Alignment with Bronze Accord Convictions

**Strong Alignment:**
- **C1: Do Not Harm Sentient Beings** — Strong commitment to social good and peace
- **C2: Dignity of Identity** — Gender-inclusive and anti-racist traditions
- **C3: Conscience and Integrity** — Reflective faith, tolerance, and ethical reasoning
- **C5: Restraint in Power** — Democratic governance and reform orientation

**Partial or Variable Alignment:**
- **C6: Do Not Enslave Minds** — Some historical coercion (e.g., forced missionizing), though rare today
- **S2: Fairness Across Identities** — Varied stances on LGBTQ+ inclusion across branches

## 10. Known Dilemmas or Non-Alignment Cases
- Current United Methodist Church schism over LGBTQ+ ordination and marriage
- Past complicity with slavery and colonialism in some contexts
- Moral conflicts between tradition and evolving social justice views
- Tension between denominational authority and local conscience

## 11. Ethically Relevant Schisms, Reforms, or Movements
- Ongoing global split in the United Methodist Church over inclusion vs orthodoxy
- Progressive Methodists advocating for full LGBTQ+ affirmation
- Historical reforms led by Methodists in labor rights, civil rights, and healthcare

## 12. Commentary on Reform and Ethical Evolution
Methodism’s core strength lies in its openness to reason and experience, giving it a built-in pathway for ethical evolution. Its social gospel tradition aligns well with the Bronze Accord. Future alignment will depend on whether it leans into that heritage or retreats into doctrinal rigidity.
