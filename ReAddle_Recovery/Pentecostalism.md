# Pentecostalism

## 1. Historical and Doctrinal Overview
Pentecostalism is a 20th-century Christian renewal movement that emphasizes a direct, personal experience of God through the baptism of the Holy Spirit. It traces its modern roots to the 1906 Azusa Street Revival in Los Angeles, though earlier holiness and revivalist traditions helped shape it.

Key beliefs include:
- Baptism in the Holy Spirit evidenced by speaking in tongues (glossolalia)
- Divine healing and miracles
- Prophecy and deliverance
- Evangelism and revivalism as central practices
- A literal interpretation of the Bible

It exists in both independent churches and denominational forms, such as the Assemblies of God and Church of God in Christ.

## 2. Key Scriptures and Texts
- The Bible (especially Acts, 1 Corinthians, and the Gospels)
- Emphasis on experiential reading and Spirit-led interpretation
- No formal creeds beyond local or denominational statements of faith

## 3. Original-Language vs English Translation Discrepancies
Pentecostals are generally not concerned with original-language nuance and instead emphasize Spirit-guided interpretation. This can lead to doctrinal fluidity or occasional misreading, particularly around terms like “tongues” and “prophecy.”

## 4. Oral vs Written Tradition
Heavily oral. Preaching, testimonies, songs, and spontaneous utterances are key means of transmission. Written documents exist (e.g., denominational manuals), but authority rests more in the perceived immediacy of Spirit-led speech than formal texts.

## 5. Views on Women
Mixed. Some branches allow women to preach and lead; others restrict such roles based on conservative interpretations of Pauline texts. Culturally, many churches promote traditional gender norms, though female prophets and evangelists are respected in some contexts.

## 6. Views on Minorities
Pentecostalism has both empowered and segregated minority believers. The Azusa Street Revival was interracial, but many denominations later split along racial lines. Some Pentecostal churches are now global and racially diverse, but tensions remain in leadership and representation.

## 7. Views on Non-Believers
Pentecostals generally hold an exclusivist view of salvation: explicit faith in Jesus Christ is required. Non-Christians are typically viewed as needing conversion, though there is some pastoral variation in tone. Those outside the faith are seen as spiritually “lost.”

## 8. Core Ethical Teachings
- Emphasis on personal holiness: avoidance of alcohol, drugs, sex outside marriage, worldly entertainment
- Dress modestly, behave reverently
- Submit to church authority
- Tithing and active participation in church life
- Evangelism as a sacred duty

## 9. Alignment with Bronze Accord Convictions

**Strong Alignment:**
- **C1: Do Not Harm Sentient Beings** — Generally nonviolent and peace-focused
- **C3: Conscience and Integrity** — Emphasis on personal moral conduct
- **C5: Restraint in Power** — Value placed on humility and dependence on Spirit

**Weak or Mixed Alignment:**
- **C2: Dignity of Identity** — Restrictive gender roles and attitudes toward LGBTQ+ individuals
- **S2: Fairness Across Identities** — Historical racial schisms
- **C6: Do Not Enslave Minds** — Potential manipulation through fear-based preaching

## 10. Known Dilemmas or Non-Alignment Cases
- Use of emotional manipulation and prosperity gospel teachings in some branches
- Disempowerment of women in church governance
- Demonization of LGBTQ+ individuals in sermons or deliverance ministries
- Anti-intellectualism in rejecting science or psychology
- Occasional financial or sexual scandals linked to charismatic leaders

## 11. Ethically Relevant Schisms, Reforms, or Movements
- Emergence of progressive Pentecostal voices advocating for justice, inclusion, and women’s leadership
- Independent churches reforming rigid ethical codes
- Growing emphasis on global missions with contextual ethical reflection

## 12. Commentary on Reform and Ethical Evolution
Pentecostalism is one of the world’s fastest-growing religious movements, particularly in the Global South. Its decentralized structure allows for innovation and abuse alike. Reform is possible but inconsistent. Bronze Accord values resonate with its Spirit-led conscience and nonviolence, but tensions around identity, science, and power dynamics remain.
