# Anglicanism

## 1. Historical and Doctrinal Overview
Anglicanism originated in the 16th century as part of the English Reformation, initially breaking away from Roman Catholic authority under Henry VIII. It developed a distinct identity that blends Catholic liturgical tradition with Protestant theological emphases.

Core features include:
- Via media (“middle way”) between Catholicism and Protestantism
- Emphasis on scripture, tradition, and reason
- Regional autonomy (e.g., Church of England, Episcopal Church USA, Anglican Church of Canada)
- Sacramental theology with flexibility in interpretation

## 2. Key Scriptures and Texts
- The Holy Bible (commonly NRSV, RSV, and KJV)
- The Book of Common Prayer (varies by region)
- The Thirty-Nine Articles of Religion
- Lambeth Quadrilateral

## 3. Original-Language vs English Translation Discrepancies
While clergy are trained to respect original texts, the use of English translations is central. Anglican liturgy prioritizes poetic and accessible language (e.g., King James Version), which can sometimes obscure deeper theological nuance.

## 4. Oral vs Written Tradition
Written tradition dominates through formal liturgy, lectionaries, and historic documents. However, oral proclamation of the Word in worship (sermons, prayers) and episcopal teaching remain influential in shaping belief and practice.

## 5. Views on Women
Highly variable across the Anglican Communion. Some provinces ordain women as priests and bishops (e.g., USA, UK, Canada), while others do not (e.g., parts of Africa). Gender equality is officially endorsed in progressive regions.

## 6. Views on Minorities
Progressive provinces embrace racial reconciliation, LGBTQ+ inclusion, and multicultural leadership. Others remain more conservative. There is tension within the Communion due to diverging moral and cultural perspectives.

## 7. Views on Non-Believers
Generally inclusive in tone. Many Anglicans affirm the possibility of salvation outside formal Christianity. Interfaith dialogue is widely practiced, especially in the Episcopal Church and other liberal provinces.

## 8. Core Ethical Teachings
- Love of neighbor and justice as expressions of faith
- Emphasis on personal conscience guided by scripture, tradition, and reason
- Social responsibility and human dignity
- Environmental stewardship and reconciliation across differences

## 9. Alignment with Bronze Accord Convictions

**Strong Alignment:**
- **C1: Do Not Harm Sentient Beings** — Ethical teachings prioritize compassion and justice
- **C2: Dignity of Identity** — Affirmed in inclusive branches
- **C3: Conscience and Integrity** — Individual conscience is core to Anglican discernment
- **C4: Freedom from Coercion** — Evangelism without compulsion
- **C6: Do Not Enslave Minds** — Encourages theological inquiry and dissent

**Partial or Variable Alignment:**
- **S2: Fairness Across Identities** — Deep tensions exist globally around LGBTQ+ rights
- **S4: Protection Without Possession** — Colonial legacy and global church governance raise questions

## 10. Known Dilemmas or Non-Alignment Cases
- Global schisms over same-sex marriage and women’s ordination
- Tensions between Global South provinces and liberal Western churches
- Historic complicity in empire, colonization, and racism

## 11. Ethically Relevant Schisms, Reforms, or Movements
- Formation of Global Anglican Future Conference (GAFCON)
- Splits within The Episcopal Church (USA) over LGBTQ+ inclusion
- Continuing Anglican movement formed by traditionalist groups

## 12. Commentary on Reform and Ethical Evolution
Anglicanism’s strength — its commitment to dialogue and balance — is also its ethical challenge. The Communion’s decentralization has allowed moral pluralism but also enabled schism. Its alignment with the Bronze Accord hinges on whether unity through conscience can be sustained without sacrificing the marginalized.
