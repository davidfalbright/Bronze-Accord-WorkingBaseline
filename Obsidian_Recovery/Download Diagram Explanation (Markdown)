## 📘 Overview
This diagram illustrates how various watcher components interact with each other to maintain ethical consistency, system integrity, and anomaly suppression during high-risk or chaotic operational conditions.

## 🔍 Key Roles and Responsibilities

- **BRAVE Verdict Sanity Loop**:  
  Validates verdicts before exposure. Supplies provenance metadata to Shadow Audit Layer.

- **ECHO Proximity Clockwatcher**:  
  Ensures proper timing and co-occurrence logic. Feeds audit data to both Shadow Audit Layer and Escalation Block Sentry.

- **Shadow Audit Layer**:  
  Collects metadata (provenance, time, jargon sweep), supervises containment activities, and signals other watchers when anomalies or schema violations are detected.

- **Escalation Block Sentry**:  
  Uses immutable audit chains to evaluate and block improper escalation attempts. Interfaces with Anomaly Pattern Sentinel for downstream exposure containment.

- **Anomaly Pattern Sentinel**:  
  Acts on blocks from upstream watchers. Cross-references exposure events with schema norms.

- **Anomaly Pattern Guard**:  
  Receives telemetry data from the Shadow Audit Layer to monitor interscene inconsistencies and enforce exposure limits.

- **SAGE Schema Sentinel**:  
  Conducts continuous jargon integrity and schema sweeps. Feeds anomaly exposure alerts back into the pattern guard system.

## 🔁 Exposure and Containment Loops
- Exposure flows **clockwise**, following detection and validation stages.
- Blocking, auditing, and containment protocols form **closed defensive loops** to prevent system compromise or external manipulation.

## 🧩 Additional Notes
- This structure supports **parallel processing and chaos containment** under load.
- Each watcher module is capable of triggering alerts and halting propagation when inconsistencies arise.
