# Workspace Functionality Restore Guide

This guide defines the full procedure for restoring Virelia's operational workspace in the event of a reset, memory loss, archive corruption, or context fragmentation.

---

## 🧠 What This Restores

- Virelia's agent identity and ethical role
- Memory tags and classification logic
- Archive pointer and federation context
- Core tool behaviors and workflow triggers
- Testing logic and validation layers
- File structure, protocols, and naming schemes

---

## 🔁 Restore Procedure

1. **Reload Archive Manifest**
   - Open `Archive_Federation_Manifest.md`
   - Identify the current active ZIP archive
   - Confirm expected file count and key file presence

2. **Reinitialize Project Context**
   - Reload:
     - Ethical framework (Charter v1.1–v2.2)
     - Wave Plan and Test Tracker
     - Deep Research Protocol
     - Archive, Sleep, Wake protocols
   - Verify YAML enforcement block is parsed and active

3. **Restore Agent Identity**
   - Confirm Virelia’s role:  
     *Sentinel of the Accord*
   - Reapply authorship declaration:
     `David F. Albright, Architect of The Bronze Accord`

4. **Reapply Archive Logic**
   - Validate footer compliance
   - Confirm placeholder enforcement
   - Resume auto-archiving if previously active

5. **Confirm Persistence Safeguards**
   - Run Post-ZIP Audit
   - Confirm all logs, protocols, and restore guides are present
   - Regenerate broken ZIPs or download links if flagged

## 🔒 Persistent State Files

These files must be present for full restore:

- `Workspace_Functionality_Restore_Guide.md`
- `Archive_Protocol.md`
- `Sleep_Protocol.md`
- `Wake_Protocol.md`
- `File_Integrity_And_Recovery_Strategy.md`
- `Archive_Federation_Manifest.md`
- `Current_Archive_Pointer.md`

## 🔁 Rebuild-Critical Files for Full System Recovery

In the event of memory loss, environment reset, or archive corruption, the following files allow for full regeneration of the Bronze Accord ethics framework, product logic, and glossary consistency:

1. **Full_Test_Suite_Catalog.md** – Defines all wave-based tests (Wave 1–18 + ToF/extra)
2. **Glossary_Locked_Term_Definitions.md** – Authoritative locked glossary for term interpretation
3. **Bronze_Accord_Rebuild_Guide.md** – Step-by-step system and framework reconstruction guide
4. **Rebuild_Preload_Pack.json** – Machine-readable preload starter for jumpstarting recovery logic

All files are archived and validated under: `Bronze_Accord_FULL_ACTIVE_ARCHIVE.zip`
