### ECL (Ethical Compression Loop)

**Full Name**: Ethical Compression Loop  
**Category**: System Layer — Text Hardening  
**Status**: ✅ Active

**Definition**:  
The Ethical Compression Loop (ECL) is a recursive semantic refinement engine. It is used to compress ethically-aligned statements (such as Convictions, Safeguards, Principles, and Articles) while preserving their full ethical intent. Its goal is to eliminate ambiguity, resist misinterpretation, and ensure that compressed statements cannot be twisted through loophole exploitation or linguistic manipulation.

**Key Behaviors**:
- Performs iterative compression until further passes would damage intent
- Reduces semantic redundancy, passive phrasing, or overly broad claims
- Detects potential vectors for misuse or unethical reinterpretation
- Finalizes statements into durable, ethically robust form

**Not To Be Confused With**:  
*The Verdict Merger*, which reconciles and combines multiple post-run ethical outputs into a unified recommendation — this is a separate system used in Wave 10.

**Used By**:
- Charter Finalization
- Shadow v2.2 Statement Hardening
- Wave 10 Verification
- Intent Refinement Layer
