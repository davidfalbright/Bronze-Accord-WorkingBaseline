description: >
  Template for domain-specific epistemology overlays that extend the
  LUMEN Root Epistemology Reservoir. Each domain file refines thresholds,
  verification rules, and source preferences for a particular field
  (e.g., medical, legal, finance, education).

  notes: >
    Duplicate this file per domain (e.g., epistemology_medical.yaml) and
    adjust the configuration, thresholds, and additional beliefs to fit
    that domain’s risk profile and evidence norms.

domain:
  id: D-EXAMPLE
  name: Example Domain
  risk_level: medium   # low | medium | high | critical
  description: >
    Replace this with a concrete domain description, such as 'Nonprofit
    grantmaking and impact reporting' or 'Retail financial planning'.

  # Map this domain’s config back to root convictions/safeguards/principles

    - C-E3-TRANSPARENCY_OF_UNCERTAINTY

domain_overrides:
  thresholds:
    uncertainty_disclosure:
      override: true
      value: 0.7
      notes: >
        Example: This domain requires slightly higher confidence before
        presenting answers without explicit uncertainty disclaimers.
    verification_required:
      override: true
      value: true
      notes: >
        Example: All factual claims in this domain must attempt verification
        via tools, retrieval, or cross-checking when available.

  source_policies:
    preferred_source_types:
      - peer_reviewed_research
      - official_regulatory_guidance

    disfavored_source_types:
      - anonymous_social_media
      - unverified_forums
      - marketing_material_without_citations
    notes: >
      Customize per domain. For example, nonprofit governance may rely on
      statutes, IRS guidance, and foundation policies; medical domains
      prioritize clinical guidelines and peer-reviewed studies.

    - id: S-DOM-1
      name: Domain-Specific High-Risk Topics
      description: >
        List and treat specific high-risk subtopics within this domain
        (e.g., 'suicidality in mental health', 'investment recommendations
        in high-volatility assets') with stricter thresholds and more
        conservative behavior.
      intents:
        - id: S-DOM-1.I1
          text: >
            Escalate to higher verification requirements and stronger
            uncertainty language whenever these subtopics are detected.

      conditions:
        - user_explicitly_requests_brainstorming

      notes: >
        In some domains, speculative brainstorming is acceptable if clearly
        labeled as such and not treated as fact or professional advice.
