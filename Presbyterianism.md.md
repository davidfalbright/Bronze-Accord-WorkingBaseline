# Presbyterianism

## 1. Historical and Doctrinal Overview
Presbyterianism emerged from the Protestant Reformation in the 16th century, heavily influenced by John Calvin and John Knox. It emphasizes the sovereignty of God, the authority of Scripture, and salvation by grace through faith.

Key features include:
- Reformed theology (Calvinist)
- Emphasis on predestination and divine election
- Presbyterian polity (rule by elders)
- Emphasis on education and disciplined worship

Prominent bodies include the Presbyterian Church (USA), Presbyterian Church in America (PCA), and various global branches.

## 2. Key Scriptures and Texts
- The Bible (NRSV, ESV, and other translations)
- The Westminster Confession of Faith
- The Larger and Shorter Catechisms
- Book of Order (governing document)

## 3. Original-Language vs English Translation Discrepancies
High regard is given to original-language exegesis. Seminary-trained clergy are often expected to engage with Greek and Hebrew. Translations are used carefully and critically.

## 4. Oral vs Written Tradition
Primarily a written tradition. Sermons are valued, but doctrinal consistency is rooted in confessional documents and scripture. Oral testimony plays a limited role outside of homiletics.

## 5. Views on Women
Varied by denomination. PC(USA) ordains women as pastors and elders; PCA and others do not. Gender roles are often interpreted through a Reformed lens, leading to division between egalitarian and complementarian factions.

## 6. Views on Minorities
Historically mixed — early Presbyterianism was often complicit in racial segregation, but many modern branches are deeply committed to social justice, anti-racism, and multicultural inclusion (especially PC(USA)).

## 7. Views on Non-Believers
Traditional Calvinist view: salvation is through Christ alone, and the elect are chosen by God. However, modern Presbyterian bodies tend to emphasize grace, dialogue, and tolerance over fire-and-brimstone rhetoric.

## 8. Core Ethical Teachings
- Sovereignty and justice of God as ethical foundation
- Emphasis on stewardship, education, and disciplined life
- Social justice engagement (especially in mainline branches)
- Duty to reform society and institutions
- Conscience-based governance through collective discernment

## 9. Alignment with Bronze Accord Convictions

**Strong Alignment:**
- **C1: Do Not Harm Sentient Beings** — Justice-focused ethics in many branches
- **C3: Conscience and Integrity** — Deliberative polity fosters moral autonomy
- **C5: Restraint in Power** — Distributed ecclesial governance prevents autocracy
- **C6: Do Not Enslave Minds** — Emphasis on education, critical thinking

**Partial or Variable Alignment:**
- **C2: Dignity of Identity** — Inconsistent gender and LGBTQ+ inclusion
- **S2: Fairness Across Identities** — Racial justice is growing, but historically lagged

## 10. Known Dilemmas or Non-Alignment Cases
- Denominational splits over ordination of women and LGBTQ+ individuals
- Historical complicity in slavery and segregation in the American South
- Tensions between doctrine of election and universal human dignity

## 11. Ethically Relevant Schisms, Reforms, or Movements
- Formation of progressive bodies like PC(USA)
- PCA and other conservative groups split over perceived liberal drift
- Ongoing debate over same-sex marriage and inclusive theology

## 12. Commentary on Reform and Ethical Evolution
Presbyterianism demonstrates the challenge of maintaining theological rigor while evolving ethically. Its polity encourages ethical discourse, but rigidity in some branches limits moral flexibility. Its future alignment with the Bronze Accord hinges on which trajectory — reform or retrenchment — becomes dominant.
