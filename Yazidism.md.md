# Yazidism

## 1. Historical and Doctrinal Overview

Yazidism is an ancient monotheistic religion primarily practiced by the **Yazidi people**, a Kurdish-speaking ethno-religious group. Its origins trace back over 1,000 years and incorporate elements from **Zoroastrianism, pre-Islamic Mesopotamian beliefs, Christianity, Islam, and Sufism**.

Yazidis believe in one supreme God who created the world and entrusted its care to **seven holy beings**, the most prominent being **Tawûsê Melek** (Peacock Angel). This being is not a fallen angel but a revered intermediary, misunderstood by outsiders due to superficial resemblances to Lucifer in Abrahamic traditions.

The religion is deeply **esoteric and initiatory**, with strict caste rules and oral transmission of teachings.

## 2. Original-Language vs. English Translation Discrepancies

Many Yazidi religious texts, including **Qewls** (hymns) and **Kitebs** (books), are orally transmitted in **Kurmancî Kurdish** and occasionally **Arabic**. Most Western sources lack deep cultural context, leading to:

- Misinterpretation of Tawûsê Melek as a devil figure
- Oversimplification of complex cosmology
- Confusion about ritual practices due to lack of standardized written doctrine

English renderings often miss symbolic depth and spiritual nuance embedded in sacred poetry and chants.

## 3. Oral vs. Written Tradition

Yazidism is **primarily oral**, with the **Qewls** recited by specially trained religious figures called **Qewwals**. While some sacred texts like the *Mishefa Reş* (Black Book) and *Kitêba Cilwe* (Book of Revelation) exist in written form, their authorship and authority remain debated, even among Yazidis.

This oral reliance ensures fluid transmission but has made the religion vulnerable to external distortion and internal fragmentation under persecution.

## 4. Treatment of Women, Minorities, and Non-Believers

Yazidism has a **strict hereditary structure**; one must be born Yazidi to be considered Yazidi. Conversion is not accepted. The community is divided into **three hereditary castes**: Sheikh, Pîr, and Murîd, with endogamy strictly observed.

Women play vital roles in Yazidi society and religious life, especially in **ritual mourning, storytelling, and home-based spirituality**. Some women serve as **spiritual leaders and hymn reciters**.

Yazidis are historically persecuted by outsiders, and doctrinally, non-Yazidis are viewed as **outside the community**, but not necessarily with hostility—just outside salvation.

## 5. Core Ethical Teachings

Yazidi ethics focus on **honor, cleanliness, truthfulness, and loyalty to the community**. Key tenets include:

- Avoiding sin through spiritual discipline
- Maintaining harmony with cosmic forces
- Honoring the Peacock Angel as the divine caretaker
- Pilgrimage to **Lalish**, the holiest site, for renewal

The faith rejects **asceticism and violence**, emphasizing balance in life and respect for sacred forces.

## 6. Points of Alignment with the Bronze Accord Convictions

- **C1 – Do No Harm**: Yazidism's ethics align with nonviolence and spiritual self-discipline.
- **C2 – Preserve Dignity**: Ritual purity and community honor reflect this deeply.
- **C5 – Uphold Truth and Understanding**: The reverence for oral transmission and sacred hymns underscores pursuit of spiritual truth.

## 7. Points of Conflict or Ethical Divergence

- **C4 – Universal Worth**: Exclusion of non-Yazidis from the religion and caste-based social structure diverge from Accord’s universal ethical openness.
- **S2 – Freedom of Belief**: No conversion allowed into Yazidism; tightly bounded identity may constrain freedom.

## 8. Influence on Law, Politics, or Governance

Yazidism historically operated **outside formal state structures**, relying on tribal governance and religious leaders. Modern Yazidis, especially in Iraq, have sought political representation and cultural protection, but the religion itself does not espouse a political doctrine.

## 9. Notable Interpretations or Sects

While Yazidism is relatively unified, some **regional variations** exist, especially among Yazidis in Armenia, Syria, and Germany. Differences lie in **ritual emphasis, linguistic practices, and cultural adaptation**, but doctrinal schisms are rare.

## 10. Commentary on Historical Application of Ethics

Yazidis have endured **systematic persecution**, most recently under ISIS, which accused them of "devil worship." Despite this, Yazidis have **refused to retaliate violently**, maintaining their ethical discipline.

The tight-knit nature of the faith has enabled **resilience**, but also restricted integration and adaptation.

## 11. Reflections from Practitioners or Critics

Practitioners describe their faith as one of **light, mystery, and loyalty**. Critics—often from Abrahamic traditions—misinterpret it due to its unique symbolism. Human rights groups advocate for Yazidi protections but also note **gender and caste rigidity** as areas of tension.

## 12. Status of Beliefs in the EBR

- ❗Insights about exclusivity and caste implications flagged for further review
