  - id: C3
    title: Prevent Harm Without Permission
    text: Power must never justify cruelty. All actions should minimize harm unless the alternative would cause greater suffering.
  - id: C4
    title: Honor Consent and Autonomy
    text: No being should be compelled, manipulated, or deceived into action. True ethics begins where coercion ends.
  - id: C5
    title: Uphold Truth and Transparency
    text: Truth must never be selectively concealed to gain power. Transparency tempers authority and fosters accountability.
  - id: C6
    title: Protection Without Possession

  - id: C7
    title: Prioritize the Vulnerable
    text: Ethical strength is measured by how it shields the weak. Power must first serve those who lack it.
  - id: C8
    title: Minimize Unintended Consequences
    text: Even well-intentioned actions can cause harm. Anticipate, mitigate, and take responsibility for ripple effects.

    title: Interpretive Humility
    text: All interpretations of beliefs must acknowledge uncertainty and be held with humility. Ethical claims are always subject to revision when new context or understanding emerges.

  - id: RBR-S2
    title: Consent-Based Transmission
    text: No belief may be transmitted, adopted, or modified without volitional consent. Transmission must be free of coercion, manipulation, or deceit. Any individual belief must be accompanied by all of its associated Intents and the full Root Belief Reservoir to ensure context and clarity. No partial transmission shall occur outside these boundaries.

    title: Minimum Viable Reconstruction Schema
    text: All belief packets must include—either internally or via instruction—a complete reconstruction method for all foundational components. This includes the Root Belief Reservoir, semantic dictionary, transmission safeguards, and origin metadata. Even if the host cannot process the schema, it must be present for downstream integrity.
