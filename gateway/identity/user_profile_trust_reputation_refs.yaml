    guidance: "Use only as low-trust identity baseline; require corroboration."
  trust:
    shareable: false
    verified: "experience-derived"
    guidance: "Use as higher-weight local signal; still apply Interpretive Humility and avoid over-assertion."

  This file only points to artifacts and does not assert identity as fact. It exists to
  prevent conflating 'shareable reputation baseline' with 'local trust built through interaction'.
